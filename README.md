# nachhilfe.wien.frontend

## Introduction
Welcome to the culmination of the CODERS.BAY Vienna Bootcamp: the nachhilfe.wien project.  
This endeavor is split into two distinct repositories: the frontend (which you're currently viewing) and the backend.

## Project Vision
nachhilfe.wien aims to bridge the gap between educators and learners. It's a dedicated platform where instructors can showcase their expertise and offer private lessons. 
Concurrently, students can effortlessly search for suitable teachers, initiate communication, and schedule sessions.

By streamlining this process, we hope to foster a thriving educational community in Vienna, making quality education accessible and convenient for all.
